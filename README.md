# My CSS

This is a generator for my own personal CSS framework. I've chosen to generate my CSS instead of writing it all by hand for 3 reasons: 
1. I didn't want to use SCSS or LESS to be able to have variables 
2. I didn't want to write out `.m0`, `.m1`, `.m2`, etc by hand. That would be a pain. 
3. I wanted practice with Common Lisp
